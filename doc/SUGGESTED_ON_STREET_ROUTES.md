**NOTE:** The bike map describes an unknown "minor multiuse pathway", running north-south along the west side of Kipling Av, between Finch Av W and Steeles Av W. This isn't listed on the Google Maps bicycling layer, nor is it visible on street view. This needs further research. 

* (+150m) Immediately turn left at the gap in the median and continue on the sidewalk for a few metres. Go down the hill into the ravine. You are now on **East Humber Trail**.
