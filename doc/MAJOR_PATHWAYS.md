## West Humber Trail

*NOTE:* This appears to be considered Route 40, if this [street view](https://www.google.ca/maps/@43.728473,-79.591935,3a,15y,160.1h,90.56t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s2koeL4TXa3E-7zyomThYyg!2e0) image is to be believed. Route numbers are conspicuously absent from the official Toronto map.
