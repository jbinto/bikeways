# Bikeways

## Overview

This is the source code for the Toronto Bikeways Guide located at http://416.bike/

This is a web application which provides user-contributed information about Toronto's bikeway  system. It is created in response to a complete lack of information about Toronto's numbered bike system.

It will be seeded with a significant amount of original content (both route research & photography). All information will be licensed under a Creative Commons style license (specifics to be determined).

This is a work in progress. Contributions are welcome.
